\usage{
normal(location = 0, scale = NULL, autoscale = TRUE)

student_t(df = 1, location = 0, scale = NULL, autoscale = TRUE)

cauchy(location = 0, scale = NULL, autoscale = TRUE)

laplace(location = 0, scale = NULL, autoscale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{Prior location. In most cases, this is the prior mean, but
for \code{cauchy} (which is equivalent to \code{student_t} with
\code{df=1}), the mean does not exist and \code{location} is the prior
median. The default value is \eqn{0}.}

\item{scale}{Prior scale. The default depends on the family (see
\strong{Details}).}

\item{autoscale}{A logical scalar, defaulting to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{df}{Prior degrees of freedom. The default is \eqn{1} for
\code{student_t}, in which case it is equivalent to \code{cauchy}.}
}
\value{
A named list to be used internally by the \pkg{rstanarm} model
  fitting functions.
}
\description{
This prior specification is just a duplicate
of some of the priors used by the \pkg{rstanarm} package. They can be passed to the
\code{stan_foot} function, through the arguments \code{prior} and \code{prior_sd}.
See  the vignette \href{http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html}{\emph{Prior
  Distributions for rstanarm Models}} for further details (to view the priors used for an existing model see
  \code{\link{prior_summary}}).
  The default priors used in the \pkg{stan_foot} modeling function
  are intended to be \emph{weakly informative} in that they provide moderate
  regularlization and help stabilize computation.

You can choose between: \code{normal}, \code{cauchy}, \code{laplace}, \code{student_t}.
}
\details{
The details depend on the family of the prior being used:
\subsection{Student t family}{
  Family members:
  \itemize{
  \item \code{normal(location, scale)}
  \item \code{student_t(df, location, scale)}
  \item \code{cauchy(location, scale)}
  }
  Each of these functions also takes an argument \code{autoscale}.

  For the prior distribution for the intercept, \code{location},
  \code{scale}, and \code{df} should be scalars. For the prior for the other
  coefficients they can either be vectors of length equal to the number of
  coefficients (not including the intercept), or they can be scalars, in
  which case they will be recycled to the appropriate length. As the
  degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the Student t distribution
  approaches the normal distribution and if the degrees of freedom are one,
  then the Student t distribution is the Cauchy distribution.

  If \code{scale} is not specified it will default to \eqn{10} for the
  intercept and \eqn{2.5} for the other coefficients.

  If the \code{autoscale} argument is \code{TRUE} (the default), then the
  scales will be further adjusted as described above in the documentation of
  the \code{autoscale} argument in the \strong{Arguments} section.
}

\subsection{Laplace family}{
  Family members:
  \itemize{
  \item \code{laplace(location, scale)}
  }
  Each of these functions also takes an argument \code{autoscale}.

  The Laplace distribution is also known as the double-exponential
  distribution. It is a symmetric distribution with a sharp peak at its mean
  / median / mode and fairly long tails. This distribution can be motivated
  as a scale mixture of normal distributions and the remarks above about the
  normal distribution apply here as well.
