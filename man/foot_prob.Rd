\title{Plot football matches probabilities for out-of-sample football matches.}
\usage{
foot_prob(object, data, home_team, away_team)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{stanfit} as given by \code{stan_foot} function.}

\item{data}{A data frame, or a matrix containing the following mandatory items: home team, away team,
home goals, away goals.}

\item{home_team}{The home team for the predicted match.}

\item{away_team}{The away team for the predicted match.}
}
\value{
A \link[data.frame]{data.frame} containing the number of out-of-sample matches specified through the
argument \code{predict}  passed either in the \code{mle_foot} or in the \code{stan_foot} function.
For Bayesian Poisson models the function returns also the most likely outcome (mlo) and a posterior
probability plot for the exact results.
}
\description{
The function provides a table containing the home win, draw and away win probabilities for a bunch of
out-of-sample matches as specified by \code{stan_foot} or \code{mle_foot}.
}
\details{
For Bayesian models fitted via \code{stan_foot} the results probabilities are computed according to the
simulation from the posterior predictive distribution of future (out-of-sample) matches. For MLE models
fitted via the \code{mle_foot} the probabilities are computed by simulating from the MLE estimates.
