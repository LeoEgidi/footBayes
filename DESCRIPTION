Description: This is the first package allowing for the estimation,
             visualization and prediction of the most well-known 
             football models: double Poisson, bivariate Poisson,
             Skellam, student_t, diagonal-inflated bivariate Poisson, and
             zero-inflated Skellam. It supports both maximum likelihood estimation (MLE, for 
             'static' models only) and Bayesian inference.
             For Bayesian methods, it incorporates several techniques:
             MCMC sampling with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational inference using
             either the Pathfinder algorithm or Automatic Differentiation Variational
             Inference (ADVI), and the Laplace approximation.
             The package compiles all the 'CmdStan' models once during installation
             using the 'instantiate' package.
             The model construction relies on the most well-known football references, such as 
             Dixon and Coles (1997) <doi:10.1111/1467-9876.00065>,
             Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) <doi:10.1111/1467-9884.00366> and
             Egidi, Pauli and Torelli (2018) <doi:10.1177/1471082X18798414>.
